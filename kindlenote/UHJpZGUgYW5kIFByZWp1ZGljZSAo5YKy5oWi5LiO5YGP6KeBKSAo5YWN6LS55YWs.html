<h2> Pride and Prejudice (傲慢与偏见) (免费公版书) (Austen,Jane;(简·奥斯汀)) </h2><p><div>1. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.&#34;</div>
